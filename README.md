## Description

Smart contracts are self-executing programs deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling decentralised and trustless transactions. This project involves developing a simple smart contract using Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain for testing and development. By utilising Truffle, a popular Ethereum development framework, a smart contract has been written, and deployed that stores and retrieves data on the blockchain. This project provides hands-on experience with Solidity, Truffle, and Ganache, which are essential tools for blockchain development.
